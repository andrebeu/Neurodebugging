# Neurodebugging

How do neurons learn to compute meaningfully? Using two-photon calcium imaging, 
I modelled dendritic integration (how inputs across the dendrite come together) 
by training an artificial neural network to predict activity at soma given activity 
across the dendrite. By building correlation matrices of the weight matrices converged 
at by different iterations, I used this model to ask questions like: Does 
learning decrease the space of computations that could account for the integrative 
properties of dendrites?
